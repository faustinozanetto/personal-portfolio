Since little I have been into programming, discovering how games were made was really interesting for me. When I was like 12 I decided to start learning Java in order to make Minecraft Plugins. I managed to release several plugins and most of theme were accepted by the community really well, one even reaching 5000 downloads on Spigot MC."

It was a hard journey, but I really learned so much about coding and programming overall. I kept used C++ for about 2 years until I started learning Web development."
